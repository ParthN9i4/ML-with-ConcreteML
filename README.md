# ML-with-ConcreteML
From tutorials provided by Zama, we try to extend the definitions for ML models like logistic regression, Neural Networks, Decision Tree, XGBoost, analyze the resource utilization in terms of memory and CPU with and without encryption  and apply them on real life problems for efficient use of PPML
